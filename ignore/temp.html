            <h2>We're All Full-Time</h2>
            <p>Teachers at the other companies are often only required to work 5 hours a week. So what is their real passion? All of our instructors have chosen careers solely dedicated to helping our students. They all work full-time and take the exams every year, so our students get the best quality instruction.</p>

            <h2>Our 100% Success Rate</h2>
            <p>No gimmicks, seriously. Every one of our students improves. The only question is how much time may be required to help students achieve their full potential. If a given test does not go as planned, we craft a new, individualized plan, which can include complimentary sessions. With us, you get the personalized attention you need to beat the exam.</p>
